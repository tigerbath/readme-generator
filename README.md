## About The Application

This application was designed to provide a quick alternative to creating clean, concise and uniform readme.md files for any project the user chooses to create. Once the user has installed the package, they start the application by typing 'npm run start', they will then be prompted with a number of questions. Once the user has given answers to these questions a completed generated readme file is filed in the 'user-generated-readme.md' file.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript - inquirer.npm - node.js

## User flow

AS a user

SO that when I run npm run start
A number of questions are prompted for me to answer
ONCE I have completed the questions
A readme is generated for me to use
